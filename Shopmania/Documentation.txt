1 Introduction
You are a single parent with four hungry children and the weekly grocery shop is becoming
difficult. Luckily, you know a bit of Python and can write a program that generates a shopping
list based on what recipes are going to be prepared that week.


3 Terminology
In the context of this Project:
recipe name: str represents the name of a recipe. Note: Recipe names should only contain
lowercase letters from the English alphabet without any numbers or special characters.
recipe: tuple[str, str] is a tuple containing two strâ€™s. The first str in the tuple represents the name of the recipe. The second str contains all the ingredients in the form
of 'amount measure ingredient_name', e.g. '115 g Nuttelex' which represents 115
grams of Nuttelex. When multiple ingredients are present, they are separated by a single comma. Note that there is no space. e.g. '115 g Nuttelex,50 g sugar' have a look
at constants.py for examples.
recipes: list[tuple[str, str]] is a list of recipes. Each recipe follows the format described
above. Duplicates can exist.
ingredient detail: tuple[float, str, str] , is a tuple containing information of a single
ingredient. (amount, measure, ingredient name), e.g. (115.0, 'g', 'Nuttelex').
cookbook is a collection of all available recipes and you may use whatever type you feel is appropriate for it. Duplicates do not exist in the cookbook.


4 Interaction
This section provides an overview of the interaction. Where prompts and outputs are not explicitly
mentioned in this section, please see Section 5.
4.1 Interaction loop
At the beginning of the interaction, the user is prompted with the message
Please enter a command:
to choose a command. Once a command is entered the user should be
prompted again.
Throughout the interaction, the user may add to or remove from the cookbook. They can also
add to or remove from the list of recipes as well. You may assume that your program will
not be tested for invalid inputs that do not match the expected commands in Table 1. The
prompt should repeat until the user quit by entering the "Q" or "q" action.
Input Description
"H" or "h" Display a help message.
"Q" or "q" Quit.
"add {recipe}" adds a recipe to the list of recipes.
"rm {recipe}" removes a recipe from the collection.
"rm
{ingredient name}
{amount}"
removes an ingredient from the shopping list.
"g" or "G" generates a shopping list based on the list of
recipes.
"ls" list all recipes in shopping cart.
"ls -a" list all available recipes.
"ls -s" display shopping list.
"mkrec" creates a recipe.
Values not surrounded by braces should be taken as string literals.
